When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share my work with other people, or when I work in team with other people on the same project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	When you pull changes manually you have full control on what you what to share and when, if this happen automatically you will not have any control over it.
